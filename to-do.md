To Do list for Markdown Conversion
==================================

1.  Figure out how to do nested lists (Lab 6 OYO).



## Lab Style Guide

1.  Section titles are formatted as header 2 (##) and followed by a blank line.

2.  Exercises are ordered lists (1., 2., 3., ...), not lazy lists 
    (1., 1., 1., ...) with two spaces after the dot (or one space for numbers 
    > 9, < 100).  Subsequent lines are hanging-indented four spaces.
    
3.  On Your Own questions are unordered lists (-, -, -, ...) three spaces 
    following each -.
    
4.  All lists items should be followed by a blank line.

5.  In-text numbers and basic math operators are not marked up. Latex is used 
    for mathematical variables (e.g. n, p) and more complex symbols and 
    equations.
    
6.  Wrap all lines, text and code, at 80 characters.  The counter can be found 
    in the lower left corner of the editor.  Long urls or strings that should 
    not be segmented can overflow.
    
7.  Force a line break with a backslash (\\).
