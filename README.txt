It is our hope that these materials are useful for instructors and students of statistics and data analysis.  If you end up developing some interesting variants of these labs, please let us know!

The source files are processed using knitr, an R package that makes Sweave easier in RStudio. If you are unfamiliar with RStudio or Sweave, you may consider creating your own copy of the Google Doc version of each lab, which can be found at http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php.
