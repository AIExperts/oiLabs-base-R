Hi Andrew and Mine,

The info requested below will be helpful for planning future labs and also for considerations of transferring lab copyrights to OpenIntro (the copyright cannot be transferred if the lab wasn't an original work). This isn't urgent, but I think it would be good to have this done within a couple weeks, and my estimate for the time it will take is about 2 hours.

1. Could you generate an "inspiration" folder (or some similarly named folder) in the OI labs directory and add copies of all labs that served as inspiration or templates for OpenIntro labs to this folder? Also, this folder could be a place to add future labs you come across that you find interesting, though future OpenIntro labs shouldn't be based on existing labs by outside parties.

2. Could you summarize the following info for each lab and put it in a single file in the primary OI labs folder? Alternative proposals for where to manage this info are welcome; I was thinking that having it the primary folder would be a reminder to update it each time a new lab is finished.

+ Name of each contributor. If UCLA-derivative but uncertain who wrote and contributed to the original, okay to put "UCLA Statistics" as a person (and then also guess who contributed).
+ Add 1-2 sentences for each person describing his/her contributions.
+ Add any notes about the lab that would be useful to know, e.g. if it is an original lab or if you think it qualifies as a derivative of a non-OpenIntro lab.

An example of a fictional lab summary is below.

Thanks,
David
