OpenIntro Labs
==============

OpenIntro Labs promote the understanding and application of statistics through applied data analysis.  Each lab corresponds to a chapter in OpenIntro Statistics, a free and open-source textbook.  These source files contain everything necessary to produce the pdf versions of the labs, which can be found along with the textbook at http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php.

The source files are processed using knitr, an R package that makes Sweave easier in RStudio. If you are unfamiliar with RStudio or Sweave, you may consider creating your own copy of the Google Doc version of each lab, which can be found at the link above. For information about knitr, please visit http://yihui.name/knitr/.

It is our hope that these materials are useful for instructors and students of statistics.  If you end up developing some interesting variants of these labs, please let us know!
